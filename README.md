My First Landing Page

Description:

Hi! This is my first landing page that I have made after learning a good bit of CSS and HTMl. The landing page will include four
main sections and a footer. It will also display how much I have learned 
from the Odin Project and other resources.

I decided to make a webpage centered around people finding a forever friend; a dog. The landing page gives people the option to sign up to become apart the specified community to get new information on the dogs and after care tips!
